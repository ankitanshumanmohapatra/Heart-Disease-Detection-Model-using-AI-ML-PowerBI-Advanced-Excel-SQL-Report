# Heary-Disease-Detection-Model-using-IoT-AI-and-ML
Using IoT, Deep Learning- ANN &amp; ML models such as  KNN, SVM, LR, Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest, I deployed a Heart Disease Detection System with 88.5% accuracy.

# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This dataset provides information on the risk factors for heart disease.

The system uses 14 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction.
